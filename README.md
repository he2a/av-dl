# Youtube-DL Automation Script

Small script to download audio or video off youtube, soundcloud and other sites supported by youtube-dl. Made for use in WSL1 environment in Windows 10, but should work in any linux distro (including termux in android) without any problem. 

## Features
This script has four basic behaviours for different content.
- For youtube video, downloads the best possible quality for video and embeds subtitle if available. 
- For youtube audio, selectively downloads the best possible audio stream, crops the thumbnail to 1:1 ratio while trimming any black bars, then embeds it in 320k mp3 output.
- For soundcloud songs, downloads the audio file and embeds the cover art. 
- For other sites default behaviour is to download best possible quality.

## Requirement
- `youtube-dl` for downloading video/audio.
- `ffmpeg` for media conversion.
