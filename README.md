# av-dl - An Audio/Video Downloader Script

Small script to download audio or video off youtube, soundcloud and other sites supported by yt-dlp. Made for use in WSL environment in windows, but should work in any linux distro (including termux in android) without any problem. 

## Features
This script has two basic behaviours for different content.
- For video, downloads the best possible quality available and embeds subtitle if possible. 
- For audio, selectively downloads the best possible audio stream, crops the thumbnail to 1:1 ratio while trimming any black bars, then embeds it in V0 MP3 output.

## Requirement
- `yt-dlp` for downloading video/audio.
- `python 3.6+` for running yt-dlp.
- `ffmpeg` for media conversion.

## Installation
Make sure you have [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) already installed and updated. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/he2a/av-dl av-dl`. Inside you will find `av-dl.sh` file. Run `chmod +x av-dl.sh` inside the directory to make it executable. Now, open the script using your text editor and change the download path to your choice and you are ready to use it.
